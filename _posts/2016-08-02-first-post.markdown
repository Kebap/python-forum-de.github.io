Here's the first blog post for the Github organisation associated with the [german python forum](https://www.python-forum.de/).

It is meant to be the home of software projects started at the forum, from within the community there.  The goal is to learn about collaboration and developing software in a team, using modern approaches and tools.

Meta discussion takes place at the [python-forum Softwareprojekte](https://www.python-forum.de/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=38779) forum thread.  Discussions about individual projects are tagged with _#pydesw_ in the thread title.

This website is also a project, which means it can be used for blog posts and announcement by (sub)projects.  It is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and lives in [its own Github repository](https://github.com/python-forum-de/python-forum-de.github.io).

Jekyll uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and you can use Github's flavor of the markup language to typeset source code with syntax highlighting:

```python
def print_hi(name):
    print('Hi,', name)

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to standard output.
```
